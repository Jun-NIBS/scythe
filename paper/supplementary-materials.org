* Method

** Assumptions

1. All contaminants sequences are known /a priori/ and are reliable.
2. A contaminant sequence with length $l_c$ in a read of length $l_r$
   will only be found between $l_r - l_c$  and $l_r$.
3. If the read is contaminated, the number of bases contaminating the
   read $n_c$ is limited to $1 \le n_c \le l_c$, and always beginning from
   the 5'-end of the contaminant sequence. While this seems limiting,
   it is the mode by which 3'-end adapter and barcode contamination
   occurs.[fn:: We have encountered Illumina data in which adapters
   contaminate the read and are present past their length in the
   3'-end. The sequence after the adapter was all poly-A
   sequence. These extreme cases can be removed by appending poly-A
   sequence to the end of the adapters in the adapters file.]
4. Contaminants will only have mismatching bases; no contaminants with
   insertions, deletions, or transpositions will be addressed by Scythe.
5. The quality line of the FASTQ file accurately estimates the
   probability of bases being called correctly.
